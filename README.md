KnowFlow is designed for environmental activists, researchers, students... anyone who wants to know the water quality using low cost and customized tools. It is based on arduino uno, currently can monitor 5 parameters: Temperature, pH, ORP, Electronic conductivities, Dissolved Oxygen, the data is stored on a micro SD card, or read directly on phone by bluetooth (except for Dissolved Oxygen). All the modules are easy to change or add. Most of the sensor used are from DFRobot and Atlas Scientific, which are the main 2 sensor suppliers for Arduino users.


This page is a collective information lists for KnowFlow, it can also be found on github, [Youku](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTYzNTA1NzU1Mg==.html?spm=a2hzp.8253876.0.0&f=27620513).
Will release this series video tutorial on youtube later soon!
